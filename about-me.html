			<p>
				Hello, my name is Pablo Ramirez and I
				will be an incoming Freshman at
				Fresno State University. I am a
				Junior Web Developer and am pursuing
				a career in computer science. I	am 18
				years old, love to watch and play sports
				and am really into programming. My life
				has been filled with roller-coasters going
				up and down.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a huge Soccer Fan. Ever since I was
				a little kid, soccer has been my passion.
				I like to play and watch it. I have many
				other hobbies like playing xbox, coding,
				watching tv, exercising and many more
				things.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I was a small kid, I always loved
				the fact that things could do	certain
				tasks. Just looking at the way that
				games, phones, computers ran, made
				me look into technology. When I was 15
				years old, it was the moment I decided to
				get into programming. It has always
				been a dream to be able to own my own
				company and make games for people to
				enjoy.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also love to figure out problems that
				have to do with coding. If you have any
				challanges for me please fell free to send
				me a link or the challange throught any of
				my social media contacts.
			</p>
